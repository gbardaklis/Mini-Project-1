## Instructions on how to run our program:
- All tasks were completed using Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/).
- Opening the notebook files in Colab will ensure that the same environment is being used.

### Task 1: Dataset Preparation & Analysis
- Task 1 was completed in the `Q1&Q2.ipynb` file
- Open the notebook file in Colab
- Once opened, make sure to upload the `goemotions.json` to session storage

- Now you can run every cell before the Task 2 heading

>Note: the commented cells in Task 1 do not need to be run, they were for exploration purposes.

### Task 2: Words as Features
- Task 2 was completed in the `Q1&Q2.ipynb` file
- This task follows the first task and therefore Task 1 must be run for Task 2 to be run
- Once Task 1 has been run, all cells past the Task 2 heading 
- 2.4 will create and write to a file called `performance.txt`
- 2.5 will create and write to a file called `experiment.txt`

### Task 3: Embeddings as Features
